# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

The loan prediction risk analysis was an exploration of supervised machine learning. The project utilized credit risk analysis data and required various methods of oversampling, undersampling, machine learning models that reduce bias, and other algorithms to analyze data. Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, we were able to run a variety of models to predict and analyze the loan status data

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
