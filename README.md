# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

The loan prediction risk analysis was an exploration of supervised machine learning. The project utilized credit risk analysis data and required various methods of oversampling, undersampling, machine learning models that reduce bias, and other algorithms to analyze data. Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, we were able to run a variety of models to predict and analyze the loan status data to determine which model most effectively accesses credit risk. We utilized six different supervised learning models: oversampling, SMOTE oversampling, undersampling, combination over/under sampling (SMOTEEN), and ensemble learners: Balanced Random Forest Classifier and Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier. 

## Results:

The results for the analysis of the six models are as follows in the areas of balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores for each:

## Summary:

Based on the results of the performance of the six models on the data set, I would choose the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier. The reason I would use this model is that the performance was better than with the other models. I would use either of the ensemble learners for the data, as both had a higher performance on the balanced accuracy score. Looking at the predicitions and the actual accuracy on these models was much better than the
